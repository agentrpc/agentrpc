AgentRPC is a universal RPC layer for AI agents. It allows you to connect to any function, in any language, across network boundaries.

## Why AgentRPC?

You might have services deployed in a private VPC, on Kubernetes, even across multiple clouds. AgentRPC gives you the tools to wrap your functions in a universal RPC interface, connecting them to a hosted RPC server that can be accessed from open standards like:

- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- SDKs with OpenAI-compatible tool definitions (e.g. OpenAI, [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/openai-sdk), LiteLLM, OpenRouter, etc.)
