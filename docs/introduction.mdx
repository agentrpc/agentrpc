AgentRPC is a universal RPC layer for AI agents. It allows you to connect to any function, in any language, across network boundaries.

## Why AgentRPC?

You might have services deployed in a private VPC, on Kubernetes, even across multiple clouds. AgentRPC gives you the tools to wrap your functions in a universal RPC interface, connecting them to a hosted RPC server that can be accessed from open standards like:

- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- SDKs with OpenAI-compatible tool definitions (e.g. OpenAI, [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/openai-sdk), LiteLLM, OpenRouter, etc.)

## How it works

1. By using our tool registration SDK, you can register functions and APIs in any language.
2. The AgentRPC platform (api.agentrpc.com) will register the function, and monitor its health.
3. You get access to OpenAPI SDK compatible tool definitions, and a hosted MCP server to connect to compatible agents.
