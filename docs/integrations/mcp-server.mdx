MCP enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools through a simple architecture: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.

## Starting an MCP Server

The TypeScript SDK includes an MCP server that can be started using:

```bash
npx agentrpc mcp <YOUR_API_SECRET>
```

This allows you to connect your data sources to AI assistants like Claude, enabling them to access relevant information and produce better responses.

## Configuration Examples

Here are some examples of how to configure your MCP server for different MCP clients.

### Claude

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentrpc": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "agentrpc",
        "mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AGENTRPC_API_SECRET": "<YOUR_API_SECRET>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentrpc": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "agentrpc", "mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AGENTRPC_API_SECRET": "<YOUR_API_SECRET>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
